## Application Description

The leaderboard database models an athlete, including
details such as their name, date of birth, and identified gender.

## ER Model

The ER diagram was created with [Lucidchart](/lucidchart.md).

## Relational Model

The Relational Model (diagram) was also created with [Lucidchart](/lucidchart.md).

## SQL Schema

This was tested using [Online SQL Interpreter](https://www.db-book.com/db7/university-lab-dir/sqljs.html)
available with the [textbook](https://www.db-book.com/db7/index.html).

```sql
CREATE TABLE athletes (
  id int,
  identifier varchar(50),
  created timestamp,
  modified timestamp,
  name varchar(50),
  dob date,
  identified_gender varchar(6),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## Example SQL Queries

After running the above schema, you can test the queries below in the [Online SQL Interpreter](https://www.db-book.com/db7/university-lab-dir/sqljs.html)
Refresh the browser if you want to start over.

```sql
INSERT INTO athletes (id, name, identified_gender, dob)
VALUES
(1, 'Andrew', 'm', '1986-12-01'),
(2, 'Ayana', 'F', '1998-06-11'),
(3, 'Hayden', 'm', '1996-07-24'),
(4, 'August', 'm', '1999-09-09');
```

Let's find all 'F' athletes.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM athletes
WHERE identified_gender = 'F';
```

Let's update all 'm's to 'M's.

```sql
UPDATE athletes
SET identified_gender = 'M'
WHERE identified_gender = 'm';
```

And now all 'M' athletes.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM athletes
WHERE identified_gender = 'M';
```

Let's delete all athletes.

```sql
DELETE FROM athletes;
```

And now the table is empty.

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM athletes;
```
